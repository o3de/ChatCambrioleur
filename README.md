#### Overview
Chat Cambrioleur is an O3DE game jam project that was created to create a puzzle-like adventure for our feline friend. The project was a collaboration between writers, enviromental artists, developers and UX designers all coming together with one goal: To make something simple and fun. We are happy to share our project to the community and look forward to seeing what the community can make of it. It involves validation logic, character animation and an enviromental models and assets free for anyone to use and explore in anyway.

#### Game Lore
Raphaël is one of the greatest Cat Burglars in the multiverse. His mission is to steal from the rich, and give to the poor. Legends have been told of him adventures acquiring some of the rarest artifacts in all existence, such as: The scratch pole of destiny, the Cat Nip essences of ye’ old lumberyard and most recently... the so evasive silver bird of immortality. Which brings him to today’s final and most dangerous mission yet: To break into the most heavily guarded fortress, known as the Catgyptian exhibit and steal the Golden Yarn of Time. Let’s see if our adventurer can endure some of the most complex scenarios and sneak our way to victory.
